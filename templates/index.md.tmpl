# TLS Provider

The TLS provider provides utilities for working with *Transport Layer Security*
keys and certificates. It provides resources that
allow private keys, certificates and certificate requests to be
created as part of a Terraform deployment.

Another name for Transport Layer Security is *Secure Sockets Layer*,
or SSL. TLS and SSL are equivalent when considering the resources
managed by this provider.

This provider is not particularly useful on its own, but it can be
used to create certificates and credentials that can then be used
with other providers when creating resources that expose TLS
services or that themselves provision TLS certificates.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.
